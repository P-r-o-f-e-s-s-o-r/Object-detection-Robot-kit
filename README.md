# Object-detection-Robot-kit
This project aims to build a basic object detection robot that identifies predefined objects (like a ball, box, or hand) using sensors or a camera with computer vision. Based on the object, it performs actions like stopping, turning, or picking. It introduces key robotics, recognition, and automation concepts.
